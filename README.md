# topDownRacer

Remember Super Sprint? Super Off Road? Top Ride in Kirby Air Ride? I loved top-down perspective racing games as a kid, so now I'm trying to recapture the magic with a slick and slidy drifting game. Rough around the edges doesn't even begin to describe the project in its current state, but I hope to make it polished and fun to play either alone or with friends!
